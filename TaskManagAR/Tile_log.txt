Radical decisions - something regression analysis will never be able to do?

The average of everything - an algorithm fails to distinguish between which patterns are meaningful and which aren’t – an additional foundational element of creativity. 

Societal context - algorithms do not understand outside context, they are unable to make adjustments based on social norms and interactions beyond the realm of their specific purpose and data set.
